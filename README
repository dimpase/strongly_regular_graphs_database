Database of Strongly Regular Graphs (SRG).

This directory contains code to parse and reproduce Andries Brouwer's online
database [1] using Sage.

Goal: associate to each set of parameters (v,k,λ,μ) a Sage graph object
      (whenever it exists) and store non-existence results. The result will be
      included into Sage.

Sage code
---------

- feasible_parameters.pyx: builds the list of all admissibles parameters
                           (v,k,λ,μ).

- constructions.py:        Builds a dictionary associating a Sage graph
                           to a set of parameters (v,k,λ,μ).

So far, 776 entries of [1] can be built. 364 are left.

Computer-friendly Andries Brouwer's database [1]
------------------------------------------------

In order to help reproduce the database, this repository contains code to parse
Andries Brouwer's html pages [1] and store it in two computer-friendly
files. They can be obtained by running 'make'.

    - brouwer.txt
    - brouwer.sobj (Sage object [2])

A comment on the actual data?
