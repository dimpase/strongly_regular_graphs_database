Database of Strongly Regular Graphs (SRG).

This directory contains code to parse and reproduce Andries Brouwer's online
database [1] using Sage.

Goal: associate to each set of parameters (v,k,λ,μ) a Sage graph object
      (whenever it exists) and store non-existence results. The result will be
      included into Sage.

Sage code
---------

The file named strongly_regular_db.pyx is a Cython file containing all the Sage
code. It contains a basic arithmetic test for a SRG to be admissible, and lists
several Sage graph constructors known to return strongly regular graphs. When
the users calls the `strongly_regular_graph` function, all these graph families
are queried in the hope that one can return the requested strongly regular
graph.

Andries Brouwer's database [1] is used to answer some queries that Sage cannot
answer by itself.

So far, 1140 entries of [1] can be built. 330 are left.

Computer-friendly Andries Brouwer's database [1]
------------------------------------------------

In order to help reproduce the database, this repository contains code to parse
Andries Brouwer's html pages [1] and store it in two computer-friendly
files. They can be obtained by running 'make'.

    - brouwer.txt
    - brouwer.json
